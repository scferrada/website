abstract = "As the Web grows, multimedia content becomes more and more important for users. However, most of the Linked Data rarely consider such information, and if they do it is only at a metadata or manual annotation level. The IMGpedia project is a large-scale knowledge-base that incorporates visual information of the images from the Wikimedia Commons dataset: it contains content-based visual descriptors of 15 million images, 450 million of visual similarity links between them, and provides links to the related DBpedia resources and semantic facts. Using IMGpedia, people can perform visuo-semantic queries for the first time on the Web of Data. In this paper we describe the creation of the IMGpedia dataset along with some statistics and query examples that it is able to answer."
